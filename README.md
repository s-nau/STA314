This is my set of solutions for STA314 in Fall 2021 with Chris Maddison. 
The structure of the code and questions are property of Chris Maddison.
Do not use any ideas, or code for any course in any school from this repository.
The solutions are my property, and may be used freely besides the one caveat outlined above.
The python solutions are under each folder.
The problems, and their corresponding latex solutions, are saved as pdfs.
